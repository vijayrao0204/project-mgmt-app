inheritenace => Swift is a Car
composition => Swift has a engine

create engine object
create wheels obects
wire the engine and wheels to the Swift

Engine engine = new Engine();

class Car{
	int n;
	Engine engine;
	List<Wheel> wheels;
	Transmission transmission;
}

class Engine{
	int numCylinders;
	int cc;
	float power;
	
	Engine(){
		numCylinders = 4;
		cc = 1200;
		power = 5.8;
	}

		this.numCylinders = numCylinders;
		this.cc = cc;
		this.power = power;
	}

		this.numCylinders = numCylinders;
	}
	
	public void setCC(int cc){
		this.cc = cc;
	}
	
	public void setPower(float power){
		this.power = power;
	}
	
}


	
class Wheel{
	boolean isTubeless;
	
	Wheel(){
		isTubeless = true;
	}
	
	Wheel(boolean isTubeless){

	}
}
